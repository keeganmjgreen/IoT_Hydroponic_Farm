  Arduino IoT Cloud Variables description

  The following variables are automatically generated and updated when changes are made to the Thing

  bool relay_1_state;
  bool relay_2_state;
  bool relay_3_state;
  bool relay_4_state;

  float TDS_water;
  float T_air;
  float RH_air;
  float T_water;
  float Ev_ambient;
  bool  SEN0503_state;

  Variables which are marked as READ/WRITE in the Cloud Thing will also have functions
  which are called when their values are changed from the Dashboard.
  These functions are generated with the Thing and added at the end of this sketch.
